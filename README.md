# CVD_Analysis

Summary of Analysis:

Basic Analysis:

Summary Statistics: Calculated basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartiles) for numerical columns like Height_(cm), Weight_(kg), BMI, Alcohol_Consumption, Fruit_Consumption, Green_Vegetables_Consumption, and FriedPotato_Consumption.
Distribution of Categorical Variables: Visualized the distribution of categorical variables like General_Health, Checkup, Exercise, Heart_Disease, Skin_Cancer, Other_Cancer, Depression, Diabetes, Arthritis, Sex, and Age_Category using bar plots and pie charts.
Correlation Analysis: Calculated and visualized the correlation between numerical variables using a correlation matrix and scatter plots.
Medium Analysis:

Age Group Analysis: Explored how health conditions and habits vary across different age groups (Age_Category) to identify trends in the prevalence of heart disease, diabetes, depression, and other cancer types.
Gender Analysis: Investigated health differences between males and females by comparing average BMI, alcohol consumption, fruit consumption, etc., based on Sex.
BMI Distribution: Plotted the distribution of BMI and categorized individuals into different BMI categories (e.g., underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese) based on standard BMI ranges.
Smoking and Health Conditions: Explored the relationship between smoking history (Smoking_History) and the prevalence of heart disease, diabetes, and other health conditions.
Advanced Analysis:

Multivariate Analysis: Performed multivariate analysis to identify relationships between multiple variables simultaneously, such as exploring how BMI, alcohol consumption, and fruit consumption correlate with general health (General_Health).
Health Risk Factors: Created a composite health risk factor by combining relevant variables (smoking, alcohol consumption, lack of exercise) and analyzed its relationship with chronic conditions like heart disease, diabetes, and depression.
Overall, this project focused on understanding various health factors and their relationships in the given dataset. It covered basic descriptive statistics, explored distributions and correlations, and delved into more advanced analyses to identify health risk factors and their impact on chronic conditions. The visualizations provided valuable insights into how different factors contribute to overall health and prevalence of specific health conditions.
